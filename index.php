// =============================================================================================================================

// === Exercise 1 ===
// Below we're defining a function, but it doesn't work when we run it.
// Look at the error you get, read it and it should tell you the issue...,
// sometimes, even your IDE can tell you what's wrong

// === Exercise 2 ===
// Below we create a week array with all days of the week.
// We then try to print the first day which is monday, execute the code and see what happens.

$week = ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday"];
$monday = $week[0];

echo $monday;


new_exercise(3);
// === Exercise 3 ===
// This should echo ` "Debugged !" `, fix it so that that is the literal text echo'ed

$str = "Debugged ! Also very fun";
echo substr($str, 0, 10);


new_exercise(4);
// === Exercise 4 ===
// Sometimes debugging code is just like looking up code and syntax...
// The print_r($week) should give:  Array ( [0] => mon [1] => tues [2] => wednes [3] => thurs [4] => fri [5] => satur [6] => sun )
// Look up whats going wrong with this code, and then fix it
// Bonus: can you fix it with changing just one character? (hard)

foreach($week as &$day){ //Used an "&" sign in front of it to make it changeable in the loop!
    $day = substr($day, 0, -3);
}
print_r($week);

// === Exercise 5 ===
// The result should be: "Copyright Â© <current year> - BeCode"
function copyright(int $year)
{
    echo "Copyright &copy; $year BeCode";
}
//print the copyright
copyright(date('Y'));


new_exercise(6);
// === Exercise 6 ===
// The array should be printing every letter of the alphabet (a-z)
// Fix the code so the for loop pushes each letter of the alphabet in the array

$arr = [];
$letter = range('A', 'Z');
for ($i = 0; $i < count($letter); $i++) {
    array_push($arr, $letter[$i]);
