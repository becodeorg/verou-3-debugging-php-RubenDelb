# PHP debugging

- Repository: `php-debugging`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning challenge`
- Duration: `1 day`
- Team challenge : `solo`

## Learning objectives
- understanding the root of bug fixing
- know what print_r, var_dump, die, echo, exit, break do
- know what to do the next time you're stuck
- give yourself the `solver's mentality`, a problem is just an opportunity to learn!

## The Mission
Debugging is the pinpoint to being a master in any coding language.  
Everyone gets errors, but the best programmers never let it stop them, and they find a way to fix it every time!

 Discover, look up, research whatever ways work for you to debug you code!

A couple of tips:
- Error messages are useful: they show you the file and line of code where stuff goes wrong.
- Not seeing any error messages, or even the infamous _white screen of death_? Check how to "turn on" errors in PHP.
- Go through the code as if you are the compiler: what happens first? What's next? Is there any stuff that doesn't get executed?

## ðŸŒ± Must-have features
Open up the [junior.php.broken](resources/junior.php.broken) file, read the comments, fix the code blocks as requested in the comments
and put the final file [expert.php](resources/expert.php) in the repository folder as requested.

You will change this junior code in expert code!
